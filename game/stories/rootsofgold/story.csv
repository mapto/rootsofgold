0,"Hello Jenkins, we've been mining in Ore City for so long and only now we've found the source of gold ",dagon,kernel,Sounds too good to be true,2,,That's a great start of the day,2,money,
2,"Our company, Goldrush Co, discovered that the roots of the Giant Tree are made of gold",dagon,kernel,This might be a risk,4,,How do we get it?,3,money,
3,"We've secured exclusive right to mine this gold, but they foced onto us working with this geologist",dagon,kernel,Slow down and let's understand better,4,,Let's see what she wants,4,money,
4,"It's actually ""arborist"", Dagon. Nice to meet you, my name is Quinn and I am an expert on trees",quinn,kernel,You'll have to explain to me,5,,How much do you want?,5,money,
5,My job is to understand as much as possible about the roots of the Giant Tree and make sure mining doesn't threaten the tree or our city,quinn,kernel,How can we do this without breaking something?,10,tree,We can show you once we take them out,10,,
,# Endgame,,,,,,,,,
1000,That worked pretty well,happyend,end,Start again,0,,Start again,0,,
1001,The tree is falling...,badend,end,Start again,0,,Start again,0,,
1002,We are out of money,badend,end,Start again,0,,Start again,0,,
,# SE sector,,,,,,,,,
10,Our analysis suggest that we can try to mine some of the roots of the Giant Tree to study it without any risks.,quinn,kernel,Sounds good,11,tree,Got it,11,tree,
11,We could start from the South East sector. This way we are away from the city's eyes and avoid any unnecessary fuss.,dagon,kernel,Good point,13,,Why would we want to hide?,12,,
12,"We're not hiding, we are just cautious",dagon,kernel,Ok,13,,I see,13,,
13,"I agree about the South East sector, it is a good idea to start from a corner and have less impact on the tree",quinn,kernel,"Ok, let's move",20,,Let's do this,20,,
20,It all seems to have gone nicely. There is no risk for the tree.,quinn,kernel,Good job,21,,Well done,21,,
21,"The gold ore is of very good quality, but it is uneven. We need to see where we mine next",dagon,kernel,What do you suggest?,30,,Let's ask Quinn what she thinks,23,tree,
23,I don't think we know what the consequences of mining more would be. We need to wait,quinn,kernel,How long?,25,,We cannot stop mining now,31,money,
25,"I cannot say, maybe years",quinn,kernel,Let's see if this is possible at all,26,,We cannot stop mining now,31,money,
26,"The question is not if, but where",dagon,kernel,Can we find a compromise?,27,,Good point,30,,
27,"I suppose risks are not too big, and we can try. But we need to be careful",quinn,kernel,Keep your eyes open for any signs of problems,30,tree,Let's move on,30,,
30,"We should mine north of our hole, I have a feeling it will be more profitable",dagon,kernel,Sounds good to me,31,,Let's ask Quinn what she thinks,23,tree,
31,Let's start digging for real,dagon,kernel,Way to go,32,,What about Quinn? Let's hear her,23,tree,
32,"If we dig, I think it should be west of our current mine, and not north of it",quinn,kernel,Let's mine north,40,,Let's dig west in the Southern sector,60,,
,# E sector before S,,,,,,,,,
40,I've already had everything prepared. We can start digging in the Eastern sector immediately.,dagon,kernel,"If it has to be, let's go there",41,,What are you still waiting for,41,,
41,Things seem very good. The Eastern sector is giving us very good returns.,dagon,kernel,Happy to hear the good news,42,,What about the tree,42,tree,
42,"The tree is still stable, but we can see that some branches are starting to dry. This is a very worrying sign",quinn,kernel,It will grow again,43,,Do you think it's very bad?,44,,
43,Of course the tree is fine. Let's move on to the North Eastern sector. I feel it is full of gold,dagon,kernel,I agree,47,money,Can we afford to continue now?,44,tree,
44,"Hard to know. It's not many branches that are suffering, but it is an early sign.",quinn,kernel,So it will be fine,45,,We need to be very careful,46,,
45,Of course there's nothing wrong with the Giant Tree. It will outlive us all.,dagon,kernel,I think so too,48,,Let's be careful,46,,
46,"Ok, we will be careful, but now let's move to the North Eastern sector.",dagon,kernel,Let's go,50,,Let me hear Quinn,47,,
47,I'd be very careful with that.,quinn,kernel,What are our options,49,,Let's move on and keep digging,50,,
48,Let's keep on digging... North East it is.,dagon,kernel,Do it,50,,It's up to Quinn,47,,
49,We dig or we dig. The alternative is digging in the Southern sector.,dagon,kernel,Let's dig south,60,,"If North East is what you want, this is what you will get",50,,
,# NE sector,,,,,,,,,
50,The North Eastern sector is very rocky. We broke two of our diggers until we managed to mine it successfully. We cannot afford digging at such cost.,robot,kernel,I shouldn't have listened to Dagon,53,,"Quinn, give me an update on the tree",51,,
51,"The dried branches are expanding, but I expected worse",quinn,kernel,"Well, not really good news",55,,At least it seems to be slowing down,52,,
52,"I wouldn't say so, but given what we're doing, it is a sort of good news.",quinn,kernel,"Ok, so now we need to pick the next sector",53,,"Is there anything we could do for it, other than stop mining?",54,,
53,"Ok, you managed to convince me that it's better heading south.",dagon,kernel,"South sector it is, let's get going",60,,"Quinn, how is the tree?",51,,
54,"Maybe we can try not to expand the current mine, but maybe try approaching it from the South West?",quinn,kernel,"You wanted to go to the Southern sector, why did you change your mind?",56,,"No, we just got an agreement on the Southern sector and we go for it.",60,,
55,"Our job is mining, and that's what we need to do. Let's mine in the Southern sector",dagon,kernel,"South sector it is, let's get going",60,,"I don't know. Quinn, do you have any ideas?",54,,
56,I don't know. I am very worried.,quinn,kernel,"Ok, if you think it is better, let's go to the South Western sector",80,,"Dagon, we need your opinion here",57,,
57,I'm also worried because we need to work. Let's go for the Southern sector already,dagon,kernel,"South sector it is, let's get going",60,,"No, let's do the South Western sector",80,,
,# South sector after SE,,,,,,,,,
60,We mined less gold than expected from the South sector. This is making investors unhappy,dagon,kernel,Then let's go back to the Eastern sector to compensate,70,,Then we go back to work on the eastern side,70,,
,# E sector after S,,,,,,,,,
70,I've already had everything prepared. We can start digging in the Eastern sector immediately.,dagon,kernel,"If it has to be, let's go there",71,,What are you still waiting for,71,,
71,Things seem very good. The Eastern sector is giving us very good returns.,dagon,kernel,Happy to hear the good news,72,,What about the tree,72,tree,
72,"The tree is still stable, but we can see that some branches are starting to dry. This is a very worrying sign",quinn,kernel,It will grow again,73,,Do you think it's very bad?,74,,
73,Of course the tree is fine. Let's move on to the North Eastern sector. I feel it is full of gold,dagon,kernel,I agree,77,money,Can we afford to continue now?,74,tree,
74,"Hard to know. It's not many branches that are suffering, but it is an early sign.",quinn,kernel,So it will be fine,75,,We need to be very careful,76,,
75,Of course there's nothing wrong with the Giant Tree. It will outlive us all.,dagon,kernel,I think so too,78,,Let's be careful,76,,
76,"Ok, we will be careful, but now let's move to the North Eastern sector.",dagon,kernel,Let's go,50,,Let me hear Quinn,77,,
77,I'd be very careful with that.,quinn,kernel,What are our options,79,,Let's move on and keep digging,50,,
78,Let's keep on digging... North East it is.,dagon,kernel,Do it,50,,It's up to Quinn,77,,
79,We dig or we dig. The alternative is digging in the Southern sector.,dagon,kernel,Let's dig south,60,,"If North East is what you want, this is what you will get",50,,
