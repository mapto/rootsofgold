0,"Hello Jenkins, welcome back. Dagon wants to speak with you immediately",robot,,Let him in,1,,What does he want?,1,,
1,Jenkins! We finally finished preparations to mine the roots of the Giant Tree,dagon,,It was about time,2,,So what's next?,2,,
2,I'm assigning you as head of the project,dagon,,"Ok, what do I have to do?",3,,I'm honored,3,,
3,Those damn regulators will only let us dig five sectors,dagon,,Damn bureaucrats,4,,Maybe there's a reason,4,,
4,That's not all... We also have to work with some stupid geologist,dagon,,What for?,5,,Who is this geologist?,5,,
5,"It's actually ""arborist"", Dagon. ",quinn,,Who might you be?,6,,Who are you?,6,,
6,"Nice to meet you, my name is Quinn and I am an expert on trees",quinn,,I hope you won't be a pain,10,,I'm looking forward to working with you,10,,
,# SE sector,,,,,,,,,
10,Our analysis suggest that we can try to mine some of the roots of the Giant Tree to study it without any risks.,quinn,kernel,Sounds good,11,tree,Got it,11,tree,
11,We could start from the South East sector. This way we are away from the city's eyes and avoid any unnecessary fuss.,dagon,kernel,Good point,13,,Why would we want to hide?,12,,
12,"We're not hiding, we are just cautious",dagon,kernel,Ok,13,,I see,13,,
13,"I agree about the South East sector, it is a good idea to start from a corner and have less impact on the tree",quinn,kernel,"Ok, let's move",20,,Let's do this,20,,
20,It all seems to have gone nicely. There is no risk for the tree.,quinn,kernel,Good job,7,,Well done,7,,
,# Decision 1,,,,,,,,,
7,I've looked at the situation and the North and Eastern sectors are dangerous to mine,quinn,,Let's mine the others then,8,,What about the others?,8,,
8,Hold on! The other sectors are too close to the city. I don't want another PR nightmare,dagon,,"Ok, we mine north to the Eastern sector then",40,,Let's be safe and go west to the Southern sector,40,,
,# E sector,,,,,,,,,
40,I've already had everything prepared. We can start digging in the Eastern sector immediately.,dagon,kernel,"If it has to be, let's go there",41,,What are you still waiting for,41,,
41,Things seem very good. The Eastern sector is giving us very good returns.,dagon,kernel,Happy to hear the good news,42,,What about the tree,42,tree,
42,"The tree is still stable, but we can see that some branches are starting to dry. This is a very worrying sign",quinn,kernel,It will grow again,43,,Do you think it's very bad?,44,,
43,Of course the tree is fine. Let's move on to the North Eastern sector. I feel it is full of gold,dagon,kernel,I agree,47,money,Can we afford to continue now?,44,tree,
44,"Hard to know. It's not many branches that are suffering, but it is an early sign.",quinn,kernel,So it will be fine,45,,We need to be very careful,46,,
45,Of course there's nothing wrong with the Giant Tree. It will outlive us all.,dagon,kernel,I think so too,48,,Let's be careful,46,,
46,"Ok, we will be careful, but now let's move to the North Eastern sector.",dagon,kernel,Let's go,50,,Let me hear Quinn,47,,
47,I'd be very careful with that.,quinn,kernel,What are our options,49,,Let's move on and keep digging,50,,
48,Let's keep on digging... North East it is.,dagon,kernel,Do it,50,,It's up to Quinn,47,,
49,We dig North or we dig North. Even if we try digging in a different direction we risk getting in trouble with protests.,dagon,kernel,"If North East is what you want, this is what you will get",50,,We don't have a choice,50,,
,# NE sector,,,,,,,,,
50,The North Eastern sector is very rocky. We broke two of our diggers until we managed to mine it successfully. We cannot afford digging at such cost.,robot,kernel,I shouldn't have listened to Dagon,53,,"Quinn, give me an update on the tree",51,,
51,"The dried branches are expanding, but I expected worse",quinn,kernel,"Well, not really good news",55,,At least it seems to be slowing down,52,,
52,"I wouldn't say so, but given what we're doing, it is a sort of good news.",quinn,kernel,"Ok, so now we need to pick the next sector",53,,"Is there anything we could do for it, other than stop mining?",54,,
53,"Ok, you managed to convince me that it's better heading south.",dagon,kernel,"South sector it is, let's get going",60,,"Quinn, how is the tree?",51,,
54,"Maybe we can try not to expand the current mine, but maybe try approaching it from the North West?",quinn,kernel,We must finish up here first,60,,It will have to wait,60,,
55,"Our job is mining, and that's what we need to do. Let's mine in the North Western sector, this sector is next to the slums. The activists don't care about the slums.",dagon,kernel,"South sector it is, let's get going",60,,"I don't know. Quinn, do you have any ideas?",54,,
,# NW,,,,,,,,,
60,"It seems to be going well. It was a bit rocky, but the machines chewed the rocks like waffers",robot,,Tell them to hurry up!,61,,How much longer do you need?,61,,
61,They are almost done. Let's start planning our next move,dagon,,I'm listening...,62,,Ok...,62,,
62,Let's go with the Northern sector,dagon,,I agree,63,,Let's see what Quinn has to say,63,,
63,We've already dug the crucial sectors. It's dangerous to go for this one,quinn,,I'm paid to finish my job. We move on!,65,,"We have one more sector, we cannot give up now.",64,,
64,"Ok, let's dig the Western Sector. This way the Giant Tree will be balanced.",quinn,,Let's avoid the activists. Let's go north,70,,Seems important.,80,,
65,Then let's get started with the Northern sector,dagon,,Let's do it!,70,,Let's go!,70,,
,# Northern,,,,,,,,,
70,We dig the northern sector,robot,,,0,,,0,,
,# Western sector,,,,,,,,,
80,We dig the western sector,robot,,,0,,,0,,

1002,They are preparing to evacuate the city. Dagon seems to be fleeing the country.,robot,badend,,0,,,0,,
1001,The activists have surrounded our headquarters. We are stopping all operations.,robot,badend,,0,,,0,,
1000,Good job! We mined as much as we could. Dagon said you'll be getting a fat bonus.,robot,happyend,,0,,,0,,
