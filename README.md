## Synopsis 

Ore City is famous with its abundance of ores and the Giant Tree. “Goldrush Company” discovered that the tree’s roots are made of gold and decided to mine them. The story is seen from the point of view of Jenkins – an employee of the company, in charge of deciding when and how much of the tree’s roots to mine. Jenkins mainly communicates with Dagon Halston – the head of the finance department; Quinn Williams – the company’s certified arborist and geologist. Arborist: also known as “tree surgeon”, expert on trees. Quinn mostly advises Jenkins to slow down with mining, as she is concerned about safety. Dagon mostly advises Jenkins to mine more, as he is concerned with the company’s bottom line. Jenkins has to decide what sectors around the tree to mine. Each decision affects 2 scores: profit and damage. These 2 numbers at the end of the game determine the outcome of the story. If the profit is less that a certain amount, Jenkins gets fired, as he failed to generate enough profit for the company. If the damage is higher than a certain amount, the tree collapses, falling on the city and causing devastation, as well as destroying the company headquarters. If the profit is enough and the damage not too much, Jenkins keeps his job and the tree doesn’t fall.
